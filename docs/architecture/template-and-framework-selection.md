# Template and Framework Selection

Based on the existing codebase analysis from CLAUDE.md, your project is already using:

- **Framework**: Remix v2 with Vite bundler
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components  
- **State Management**: Zustand for client state
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom shadcn/ui layer
- **API Integration**: OpenAPI-generated client with typed endpoints
- **Build Tool**: Vite (integrated with Remix)

Since you already have an established Remix v2 application, we're working with a mature frontend architecture rather than starting from a template. Your current setup represents a modern, full-stack approach with excellent developer experience tooling.
