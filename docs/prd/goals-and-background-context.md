# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Achieve end-to-end business process automation for SMBs (customer management → procurement → inventory → invoicing)
- Establish type-safe, maintainable ERP platform that scales with business growth

- Provide modern UX/UI that reduces training time to under 2 hours per user

### Background Context
The ERP Frontend Application addresses critical inefficiencies faced by small-to-medium businesses operating with fragmented, disconnected systems. Traditional ERP solutions fall into two problematic categories: over-engineered enterprise systems that are cost-prohibitive for SMBs, or simple tools that lack comprehensive business management depth. 

This modern web-based solution leverages Remix v2, TypeScript, and component-driven architecture to deliver enterprise-grade functionality with contemporary development standards. The system targets the $1M-$50M revenue SMB market, providing unified management of accounting, inventory, purchasing, and customer relations through a type-safe, performance-optimized platform that combines server-side rendering with rich client-side interactivity.
