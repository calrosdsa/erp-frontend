## Epic 1: Task Management - Brownfield Enhancement

### Epic Goal
Implement task management functionality by replicating and adapting the existing deal module patterns to create `home.task` and `home.task.$id` routes, providing users with comprehensive task tracking capabilities integrated into the existing ERP system.

### Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: Deal management with kanban board, detail modals, CRUD operations, stage transitions, and participant management
- Technology stack: Remix v2, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Zustand, React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Integration points: API client with OpenAPI types, session management, role-based access control, existing modal patterns

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Creating complete task management module mirroring deal functionality structure
- How it integrates: Following existing patterns from `home.deal` and `home.deal.$id` with task-specific API endpoints `/task`, stages for task workflows, and participant management
- Success criteria: Functional task listing, task detail modal, task creation/editing, task transitions, and integration with existing navigation

### Stories

1. **Story 1: Task List and Kanban Implementation**
   - Create `home.task/route.tsx` with task loading, kanban board display, and task transition actions
   - Implement task kanban client component with drag-and-drop functionality
   - Create task card components following deal-card patterns
   - Set up task-specific API integration using existing `/task` endpoints

2. **Story 2: Task Detail Modal and CRUD Operations**
   - Create `home.task.$id/route.tsx` with task detail loading and CRUD actions
   - Implement task modal with form components and validation
   - Create task schema and data mapping utilities
   - Implement task detail tabs (info, participants, activities) following deal modal structure

### Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (using existing `/task` endpoints)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (no schema changes required)
- [x] UI components follow existing shadcn/ui and modal patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (following existing loader optimization patterns)

### Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Code duplication and maintenance overhead from replicating deal patterns
- **Mitigation:** Follow existing architectural patterns exactly, reuse shared components where possible, and maintain consistent API integration patterns
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove task routes and components, restore original routing configuration

### Definition of Done

- [x] Task kanban board displays tasks with stage-based organization
- [x] Task detail modal provides full CRUD operations
- [x] Task transitions work between stages
- [x] Task creation and editing forms function correctly
- [x] Existing deal functionality remains unaffected
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [x] Linting passes without violations

### Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**
- [x] Epic can be completed in 2 stories maximum
- [x] No architectural documentation is required (following existing patterns)
- [x] Enhancement follows existing deal module patterns exactly
- [x] Integration complexity is manageable (reusing existing API client patterns)

**Risk Assessment:**
- [x] Risk to existing system is low (isolated new routes)
- [x] Rollback plan is feasible (remove new files)
- [x] Testing approach covers existing functionality (no changes to existing code)
- [x] Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points (following deal patterns)

**Completeness Check:**
- [x] Epic goal is clear and achievable
- [x] Stories are properly scoped for development focus
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Dependencies on existing deal patterns are identified

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing Remix v2 ERP system running TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Integration points: `/task` API endpoints, existing modal patterns, session management, OpenAPI client
- Existing patterns to follow: `home.deal` and `home.deal.$id` route structure, modal layouts, kanban components, form validation with Zod schemas
- Critical compatibility requirements: Maintain existing deal functionality, follow established code conventions, use existing component patterns
- Each story must follow the existing architectural patterns while creating task-specific implementations

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering comprehensive task management functionality following the proven deal module patterns."
