# ERP Frontend Application Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Reduce operational inefficiency by 40% through unified system integration
- Increase user productivity by 30% with streamlined workflows and reduced context switching  
- Enable 50% faster feature delivery through modern development architecture
- Achieve end-to-end business process automation for SMBs (customer management → procurement → inventory → invoicing)
- Establish type-safe, maintainable ERP platform that scales with business growth
- Deliver real-time visibility across all business operations eliminating data silos
- Provide modern UX/UI that reduces training time to under 2 hours per user

### Background Context
The ERP Frontend Application addresses critical inefficiencies faced by small-to-medium businesses operating with fragmented, disconnected systems. Traditional ERP solutions fall into two problematic categories: over-engineered enterprise systems that are cost-prohibitive for SMBs, or simple tools that lack comprehensive business management depth. 

This modern web-based solution leverages Remix v2, TypeScript, and component-driven architecture to deliver enterprise-grade functionality with contemporary development standards. The system targets the $1M-$50M revenue SMB market, providing unified management of accounting, inventory, purchasing, and customer relations through a type-safe, performance-optimized platform that combines server-side rendering with rich client-side interactivity.

The interface should feel familiar to users of contemporary web applications, emphasizing clarity, efficiency, and contextual information display. Focus on reducing the learning curve from complex traditional ERP systems to under 2 hours training time through progressive disclosure and task-oriented layouts.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Dashboard-Centric Navigation:** Central command center with role-based widget configuration and real-time metrics
- **Modal Detail Views:** Overlay dialogs for entity details (customers, orders, invoices) maintaining workflow context
- **Tab-Based Deep Navigation:** Organized information architecture within complex entities using tab patterns
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show essential information first with expandable sections for detailed data
- **Contextual Actions:** Right-click menus and contextual buttons based on user permissions and current state
- **Bulk Operations:** Multi-select capabilities for batch processing of common tasks

### Core Screens and Views
- **Authentication Screen:** Clean, branded login with session management
- **Main Dashboard:** Configurable widgets showing KPIs, recent activities, and quick actions

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Responsive web application optimized for desktop workflows (primary) with full tablet and mobile browser support for field operations and executive dashboard access. No native mobile applications in MVP scope.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing both frontend (Remix v2) and backend services with shared TypeScript type definitions generated from OpenAPI specifications. This aligns with your current project structure and enables efficient development workflow with synchronized API contracts.

### Service Architecture
Full-stack Remix v2 application with integrated backend API services following RESTful patterns. The architecture leverages Remix's server-side rendering capabilities combined with OpenAPI-generated client types for end-to-end type safety. Backend services provide business logic and data persistence while frontend handles presentation and user interaction through server-side rendering with selective client-side hydration.

### Testing Requirements
Comprehensive testing pyramid including unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints and database interactions, and end-to-end tests for critical user workflows. Testing framework should integrate with TypeScript compilation and support automated CI/CD pipeline execution. Manual testing convenience methods required for complex ERP workflow validation.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations and migration management
- **Authentication:** Session-based authentication with secure HTTP-only cookies and CSRF protection
- **State Management:** Zustand for client-side state with server state managed through Remix loaders/actions
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library for consistent design system
- **Build System:** Vite bundler with TypeScript compilation and hot module replacement
- **API Specification:** OpenAPI 3.0 for API documentation and type generation
- **Deployment:** Docker containerization with cloud-native deployment capabilities (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- **Development Tools:** ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode, and automated pre-commit hooks
- **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time application performance monitoring and error tracking
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing, building, and deployment with branch protection and code quality gates

### Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS**: None identified

**HIGH**: 
- Add local testability requirements to backend/data story acceptance criteria (Epic 1: Stories 1.3, 1.4, 1.5)
- Specify CLI testing approaches for database operations and authentication flows

**MEDIUM**:
- Consider adding performance benchmarks for specific user workflows
- Define error handling patterns more explicitly across stories

**LOW**:
- Add mobile-specific acceptance criteria for responsive features
- Consider internationalization hooks for future expansion

### MVP Scope Assessment
- **Scope Appropriateness**: Excellent balance between comprehensive ERP functionality and achievable MVP
- **Sequential Logic**: Epics follow logical dependencies with proper foundation-building
- **Story Sizing**: Stories appropriately sized for AI agent execution (2-4 hour focused sessions)
- **Business Value**: Each epic delivers independent, deployable value while building toward complete solution
- **Timeline Realism**: 6-month delivery achievable with stories sized for development efficiency

### Technical Readiness
- **Architecture Guidance**: Comprehensive technical assumptions with clear technology stack
- **Integration Points**: Well-defined data relationships between epics and external systems  
- **Performance Requirements**: Specific, measurable performance targets established
- **Security Framework**: Role-based access control and audit requirements clearly specified
- **Development Foundation**: First epic establishes all necessary infrastructure and patterns

### Recommendations

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Add local testability acceptance criteria to backend stories (Stories 1.3, 1.4, 1.5)
2. Specify CLI commands for testing database operations, authentication, and role management
3. Define performance testing approaches for API endpoints and data operations

**Quality Enhancements**:
1. Add specific error handling patterns to Story 1.2 (Core Application Structure)
2. Include mobile-specific acceptance criteria for dashboard and navigation stories
3. Consider adding API documentation requirements to technical stories

**Next Steps**:
1. **PROCEED TO ARCHITECTURE PHASE** - PRD provides sufficient detail for technical design
2. Begin architectural design with focus on database schema and API contracts
3. Prioritize Epic 1 implementation planning with development environment setup

### Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The requirements provide clear business context, technical constraints, and implementation guidance necessary for successful development planning.
